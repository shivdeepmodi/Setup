rem     Notes:
rem     Trendline through AWR OS stats
rem
rem     Accesses data for current instance and DBID
rem
rem     Hard coded to go 30 days back in history
rem     Ignores database restarts
rem
rem     Reports a timestamp at the start of an interval
rem     with the activity that happened in that interval
rem
rem     The join on snap_id + 1 is valid for AWR because
rem     of the way AWR generates snapshot ids. (This is
rem     not safe for statspack unless you set the sequence
rem     to nocache).
rem
rem     Change the following define to pick a different statistic
rem     The available OS stats are platform dependent

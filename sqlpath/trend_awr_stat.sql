rem     Notes:
rem     Trend through AWR system stats
rem     Accesses data for current instance and DBID
rem
rem     Hard coded to go 30 days back in history
rem
rem     Reports a timestamp at the start of an interval
rem     with the activity that happened in that interval
rem
rem     Ignores database restarts
rem
rem     Generally okay to pick up the next snap_id because of
rem     the way that the AWR code generates snapshot ids
rem     (Not true for statspack unless you set the sequence
rem     to nocache).
rem
rem     Change the following define to pick a different statistic
rem

--define m_stat_name = 'SQL*Net message to/from client'
define m_stat_name = 'CPU used by this session'
--define m_stat_name = 'db file sequential read'
